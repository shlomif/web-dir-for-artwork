Artdir Stage 1 - Functional Specification
=========================================

Introduction
------------

This is a functional spec for a web-based artwork directory 
(possibly called freshfic, artdir etc.), which will allow for categorising,
browsing and searching for artworks available on the web, as well as for
announcing new releases of them and progress.

This spec uses a theme based on the movie
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceballs[Spaceballs].

Categorizing an artwork
-----------------------

Yogurt, the old wiseman, has decided to expand his merchandising empire to
web fiction. As such, he is going to make his bestselling book 
"Spaceballs - The Illustrated Children's Book" available for purchase on his 
web-site, under the CC-by-nc-sa.

In order to gain recognition, Yogurt goes to http://freshfic.tld/ and
registers using either of:

1. The standard registration process of filling in a username, E-mail and 
password twice, getting the confirmation E-mail, and filling the details.

2. Using OpenID.

3. Maybe some other methods in the future.

After Yogurt registered and confirmed his E-mail, he submits a new entry 
filling in:

1. The name - "Spaceballs - The Illustrated Children's Book".

2. Categories:
** Fiction → Prose → Children's Books → Illustrated Children's Books
** Genre: Science Fiction ; Comedy ; Parody
** Language: English
** License: CC-by-nc-sa

real money from merchandising! Follow the tale of Yogi and Urtbot as they

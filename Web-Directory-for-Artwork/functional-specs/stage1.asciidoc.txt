Artdir Stage 1 - Functional Specification
=========================================

Introduction
------------

This is a functional spec for a web-based artwork directory 
(possibly called freshfic, artdir etc.), which will allow for categorising,
browsing and searching for artworks available on the web, as well as for
announcing new releases of them and progress.

This spec uses a theme based on the movie
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceballs[Spaceballs].

New Submission
--------------

Yogurt, the old wiseman, has decided to expand his merchandising empire to
web fiction. As such, he is going to make his bestselling book 
"Spaceballs - The Illustrated Children's Book" available for purchase on his 
web-site, under the CC-by-nc-sa.

In order to gain recognition, Yogurt goes to http://freshfic.tld/ and
registers using either of:

1. The standard registration process of filling in a username, E-mail and 
password twice, getting the confirmation E-mail, and filling the details.

2. Using OpenID.

3. Maybe some other methods in the future.

After Yogurt registered and confirmed his E-mail, he submits a new entry 
filling in:

1. The name - "Spaceballs - The Illustrated Children's Book".

** Fiction → Prose → Children's Books → Illustrated Children's Books

Public view
-----------

Lone Starr is taking a break from his job as a space rogue, and decides to
see what's new in the world of Public cultural works. He heads to  
http://freshfic.tld/ and views the front page where he sees many interesting
submissions with releases:

* Songs of Druidia - a collection of King Roland's favourite songs.
* How to avoid air pollution - by President Skroob.
* The Druish Princess Way-of-Life - by Princess Vespa.

And naturally:

*  "Spaceballs - The Illustrated Children's Book" - by Yogurt.

Since Yogurt's work piques his interests the most, he goes to check it out
and read it.

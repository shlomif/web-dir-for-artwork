Hopefully, this will be a web directory for artwork (such as fiction, music,
videos, etc.) similar to what http://freshmeat.net/ is for software - i.e:

1. Provide a way to categorise and find artwork.

2. Provide a way to get feeds for various categories and sub-divisions
of artwork.

The engine will be open-source under the permissive MIT/X11 licence.
